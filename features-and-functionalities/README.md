Feature Breakdown

User Management
Handles registration, login, profile updates, and role assignment (guest or host). This feature ensures secure access and personalized experiences, allowing users to manage their bookings or listings depending on their role.

Property Management
Enables hosts to create, update, and manage property listings with details like location, pricing, amenities, and availability. It‚Äôs the backbone of the platform, allowing inventory to be discoverable and bookable by guests.

Booking System
Allows guests to search for available properties, select dates, and confirm reservations. It manages availability, prevents double-booking, and tracks booking statuses (pending, confirmed, cancelled), ensuring a smooth transaction flow.

Payment Integration
Facilitates secure online payments for bookings using methods like credit cards or PayPal. It handles transaction validation, refunds, and payment status updates, ensuring financial transparency and trust between users.

Review & Rating System
Lets guests leave feedback and ratings after their stay, which helps future users make informed decisions. It also encourages hosts to maintain high standards and builds credibility across the platform.

Search & Filter Functionality
Provides users with tools to find properties based on location, price, amenities, and availability. This enhances usability and helps guests quickly discover listings that match their preferences.

Admin Dashboard
Gives administrators control over user accounts, listings, and reported issues. It‚Äôs essential for maintaining platform integrity, resolving disputes, and enforcing policies.

API Security

Authentication: Verifies user identity before granting access.
Implementation:
‚Ä¢ 	Multi-factor authentication (MFA)
‚Ä¢ 	OAuth2 or OpenID Connect for federated identity
‚Ä¢ 	Device fingerprinting for returning users
To prevents unauthorized access and impersonation, especially critical for admin dashboards, payment initiation, and sensitive user actions.

Authorization: Determines what authenticated users are allowed to do.
Implementation:
‚Ä¢ 	Role-based access control (RBAC)
‚Ä¢ 	Attribute-based access control (ABAC) for dynamic permissions
‚Ä¢ 	Least privilege principle enforcement
Ensures users can only perform actions appropriate to their role‚Äîvital for separating merchant, tester, and admin capabilities in your acceptance matrix workflows.

Rate Limiting & Throttling: Controls the number of requests a user or IP can make in a given time.
Implementation:
‚Ä¢ 	Token bucket or leaky bucket algorithms
‚Ä¢ 	IP-based and user-based rate limits
‚Ä¢ 	Adaptive throttling based on risk signals
Protects against brute-force attacks, bot abuse, and denial-of-service attempts‚Äîespecially important for login endpoints and BIN/MCC testing APIs.

Data Encryption: Secures data in transit and at rest.
Implementation:
‚Ä¢ 	TLS 1.3 for all communications
‚Ä¢ 	AES-256 for database encryption
‚Ä¢ 	Encrypted backups and secure key management
Safeguards sensitive data like cardholder info, merchant credentials, and test results from interception or leakage.

Input Validation & Sanitization: Prevents malicious input from compromising the system.
Implementation:
‚Ä¢ 	Whitelisting input formats
‚Ä¢ 	Escaping output to prevent XSS
‚Ä¢ 	SQL injection protection via parameterized queries
Shields your scoring rubrics, trackers, and dashboards from being manipulated or corrupted by attackers.

Audit Logging & Monitoring: Tracks system activity for security and compliance.
Implementation:
‚Ä¢ 	Immutable logs with timestamping
‚Ä¢ 	Real-time anomaly detection
‚Ä¢ 	Alerting on suspicious access patterns
Enables forensic analysis, accountability, and early detection of breaches‚Äîespecially useful in payment testing workflows and risk profiling.

Secure Payment Processing: Ensures transactions are safe and compliant.
Implementation:
‚Ä¢ 	PCI DSS compliance
‚Ä¢ 	3D Secure 2.0 integration
‚Ä¢ 	Tokenization of card data

# Airbnb Clone Backend ‚Äì Features & Functionalities

This diagram outlines the core backend features for the Airbnb Clone project, including user authentication, property management, booking system, payments, and API design.

## üìç Optional Enhancement: Location Tracking

To improve user experience, the backend may support location-based filtering:
- Store latitude and longitude in property listings
- Use geospatial queries to find nearby properties
- Detect user location via browser APIs (frontend)
- Respect user privacy with opt-in controls

This feature is not required by the ALX spec but demonstrates initiative and real-world relevance.
